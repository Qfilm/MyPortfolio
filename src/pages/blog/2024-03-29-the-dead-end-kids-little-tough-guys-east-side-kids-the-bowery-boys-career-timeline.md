**A﻿n extensive timeline of the Hollywood careers belonging to the Dead End Kids, Little Tough Guys, East Side Kids as well as both Leo Gorcey's Bowery Boys, and Huntz Hall's Bowery Boys.**

In 1935, a group of young kids that included Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Billy Halop, Bobby Jordan, Bernard Punsly, and Gabriel Dell were hired to star in Sidney Kingsley's New York City Broadway play entitled 'Dead End'. In 1937, Samuel Goldwyn, the founder of Samuel Goldwyn Productions, was impressed by the play and offered the kids a contract, as well as adapted the Broadway play into a motion picture. As a result, the kids moved to Hollywood and formed a group known as the 'Dead End Kids'. During the film production of *Dead End* (1937), however, the kids caused trouble and began to break the studio's sets, to which Samuel Goldwyn decided to sell their contract to Warner Bros. once the film production ended. Under their new contract at Warner Bros., the Dead End Kids were immediately thrown into two motion pictures in 1938. The first Warner's studio picture that the kids worked on was Lewis Seiler's *Crime School* (1938), acting alongside Humphrey Bogart. The second picture was Michael Curtiz' *Angels with Dirty Faces* (1938), wherein the kids were mentored by James Cagney, while Humphrey Bogart played a supporting role.

The same year, four out of the six members of the Dead End Kids—not including Leo Gorcey and Bobby Jordan—agreed to be hired by Universal Pictures to star in Harold Young's *Little Tough Guy* (1938). Leo Gorcey's brother, David Gorcey, joined the cast of Little Tough Guy, along with Hal E. Chester, with both actors essentially replacing Leo Gorcey and Bobby Jordan. As the picture achieved commercial success, Huntz Hall, Billy Halop, Bernard Punsly, and Gabriel Dell signed a contract with Universal Pictures to launch a 'Little Tough Guys' film series. Bobby Jordan eventually signed with Universal Pictures to become a part of the film series, while Leo Gorcey remained solely under contract with Warner Bros. At this point in their careers, the group of kids (except for Leo Gorcey) were a part of two separate groups: the Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys. Now, the Dead End Kids were still contract players for Warner Bros., so they continued to show up in Warner Bros. studio pictures wherever needed. Thus, in 1939, the Dead End Kids acted alongside John Garfield and Claude Rains in *They Made Me a Criminal* (1939), their own juvenile delinquency picture: *Hells Kitchen* (1939), *Angels Wash Their Faces* (1939), and *On Dress Parade* (1939).

The next part of the kids' movie career is kind of complicated to explain. As their careers progressed, it became harder for the kids to be available at the same time. Some of them may have been working over at Warner Bros., while others were working over at Monagram Pictures Corporation or Universal Pictures. For the sake of the timeline, I will start with the run of Universal Pictures' studio projects that several of Warner Bros.' Dead End Kids worked on. Throughout the early 1940s, Universal needed The Dead End Kids (which were known as Little Tough Guys at Universal) to star in a number of pictures, but that didn't always go to plan. So, Universal was, therefore, required to use the kids that were available and place them in crime pictures with their other contract players. This wasn't a major issue, however, as this group of kids quickly became familiar with one another. It also wasn't the first time that most of those kids worked together, either. Billy Halop and Huntz Hall starred in *Call a Messenger* (1940) as the Dead Kid Ends, while David Gorcey, Hal E. Chester, Billy Benedict, and Harris Berger filled the remaining roles but were known as Little Tough Guys. So, Billy Halop and Huntz Hall weren't part of the Little Tough Guys in this picture and various other projects after this, as Universal wanted these specific pictures to have two separate groups in them, even though the two Dead End Kids have been a part of the Little Tough Guys in previous films. I did tell you this was kind of complicated.

Beginning with *Call a Messenger*, Universal decided to market their crime pictures as "Billy Halop and Huntz Hall of the Dead End Kids with the Little Tough Guys." This marketing technique continued in *You're Not So Tough* (1940), a serial film: *Junior G-Men* (1940), *Give Us Wings* (1940), *Hit the Road* (1941), *Mob Town* (1941), *Sea Raiders* (1941), another serial film: *Junior G-Men of the Air* (1942), *Tough As They Come* (1942), and *Mug Town* (1942). In some of these films, various members of the Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys may have either joined together, moved groups for certain films, or otherwise not acted in all of them. Sometimes, it may have only been two Dead End Kids and one other contract player, such as David Gorcey. The cast never consisted of the exact same recurring actors that were signed with Universal. It was all just a matter of: "If he's available, we'll put him with him and have him in that group, and we also need one more player to fill this role.". It was just a bit of chopping and changing wherever needed and wherever was possible, really.

Going back to the year 1940, Sam Katzman, the producer of Monogram Pictures Corporation, desired to construct his own group of tough kids, inspired by the Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys. Therefore, the producer decided to green-lit a newly developed film called *East Side Kids* (1940), starring two members of the Little Tough Guys: Hal E. Chester and Harris Berger. The rest of the East Side Kids' roles were filled in by various other contract players that worked over at Monogram Pictures. After the release of Monogram Picture's East Side Kids film, Katzman signed Leo Gorcey and Bobby Jordan to star in an East Side Kids film series, starting with *Boys of the City* (1940). The rest of this group was filled out by David Gorcey, Hal E. Chester, Frankie Burke, Ernest Morrison (also known as Sunshine Sammy), Donald Haines, and Eugene Francis. These were the main East Side Kids.

The type of films within the East Side Kids series were known as 'B-grade pictures'. They were low-budget films. But not to the point where they had no quality at all. They were just low-budget compared to other Hollywood studios's major-budget projects. But, then again, Monogram Pictures was a budgeted studio. Their business model wasn't as ambitious or money-oriented as that of Universal Pictures or Warner Bros. The primary purpose of the East Side Kids film series was to play each picture as part of a double feature, specifically within theatres that only play double features. So, you may have watched a 60+ minute East Side Kids 'B' picture before a main attraction film began. It was something that audiences always knew they were going to get on a Saturday morning or afternoon when they went to a movie theatre.

Following Boys of the City, the East Side Kids film series took off, which led to them starring in a number of Monagram's studio pictures, such as *That Gang of Mine* (1940), *Pride of the Bowery* (1940), and *Flying Wild* (1941). From this point on, Huntz Hall joined the group and became the newest member of the East Side Kids. The first film that Huntz Hall starred in as a member of the gang was *Bowery Blitzkrieg* (1941). The next picture that the gang starred in together was *Spooks Run Wild* (1941), a horror comedy wherein the kids worked with Bela Lugosi, a major horror actor who worked primarily for Universal. Gabriel Dell joined the group for their next run of films, consisting of: *Mr. Wise Guy* (1942), *Let's Get Tough!* (1942), *Smart Alecks* (1942), *'Neath Brooklyn Bridge* (1942), *Kid Dynamite* (1943), *Clancy Street Boys* (1943), another horror-comedy with Bela Lugosi as well as Ava Gardner: *Ghosts on the Loose* (1943), *Mr. Muggs Steps Out* (1943), *Million Dollar Kids* (1944), *Follow the Leader* (1944), *Block Busters* (1944), *Bowery Champs* (1944), *Docks of New York* (1945), *Mr. Muggs Rides Again* (1945), and the final East Side Kids picture, *Come Out Fighting* (1945).

In 1945, Leo Gorcey informed Monagram Pictures Corporation that he desired a higher weekly salary for his role in the East Side Kids film series. Monagram Pictures refused his request, which led to Leo Gorcey leaving the group. Gorcey, his agent, Jan Grippo, and Huntz Hall decided to form a production company called Jan Grippo Productions. Under their new production company, Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall revived the East Side Kids film series at Monagram Pictures Corporation. As well as reviving the series, they also revamped it, which resulted in the series being renamed Leo Gorcey and The Bowery Boys. Gorcey led the group along with Huntz Hall, Bobby Jordan, Billy Benedict, and David Gorcey. Those were the main members of the group. William Frames did start out as a main member of the group in The Bowery Boys first picture, *Live Wires* (1946), but that didn't last long. It was in their next picture, *In Fast Company* (1946), that David Gorcey permanently filled that role.

Throughout the film series, each main member of the group played the same character. Leo Gorcey played 'Slip Mahoney', Huntz Hall played 'Sach Jones', Bobby Jordan was given his own name, 'Bobby' for his character, William Benedict was known as 'Whitey', and David Gorcey was referred to as 'Chuck'. Gabriel Dell also had recurring performances within the series. He was known as 'Gabe Moreno'. But he didn't join until a little while into the series. Eventually, he was classified as a main member of the group. Additionally, Bennie Bartlett played the role of 'Butch', a key member of the gang; however, he was eventually replaced in that role by Buddy Gorman.

After *In Fast Company*, Leo Gorcey and The Bowery Boys starred in a long run of pictures together, which consisted of: *Bowery Bombshell* (1946), *Spook Busters* (1946), *Mr. Hex* (1946), *Hard Boiled Mahoney* (1946), *News Hounds* (1947), and *Bowery Buckaroos* (1947), Bobby Jordan's last film with the group. The remaining kids went on to star in *Angels' Alley* (1948), *Jinx Money* (1948), *Smugglers' Cove* (1948), *Trouble Makers* (1948), *Fighting Fools* (1949), *Hold That Baby!* (1949), *Angels in Disguise* (1949), *Master Minds* (1949), *Blonde Dynamite* (1950), *Lucky Losers* (1950), *Triple Trouble* (1950), *Blues Busters* (1950), *Bowery Battalion* (1951), *Ghost Chasers* (1951), *Let's Go Navy!* (1951), *Crazy Over Horses* (1951), *Hold That Line* (1952), *Here Come the Marines* (1952), *Feudin' Fools* (1952), and the final "Monograms Pictures Corporation production" of the series: *No Holds Barred* (1952). Monagram Pictures was still working with the kids for the remainder of the series, but the production company changed its name to Allied Artists Pictures. Under their new name, Allied Artists Pictures continued to produce and distribute the film series for the boys. Their remaining pictures included Jalopy (1953), *Loose in London* (1953), and *Clipped Wings* (1953).

There were more films in the series that were made under Allied Artists; however, the name of the group was slightly altered from this point on. Huntz Hall's name was eventually added to the group's title alongside Leo Gorcey's. Therefore, in *Private Eyes* (1953), the group was known as Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, and The Bowery Boys. This continued through films such as: *Paris Playboys* (1954), *The Bowery Boys Meet the Monsters* (1954), *Jungle Gents* (1954), *Bowery to Bagdad* (1955), *High Society* (1955), *Spy Chasers* (1955), *Jail Busters* (1955), *Dig That Uranium* (1955), and the final film of the series starring Leo Gorcey: *Crashing Las Vegas* (1956). There were a couple of key reasons why Leo once again left the group, this time for good. Gorcey was dealing with major life issues as well as difficulties accepting his weekly salary (once again). There was no other way around him gaining an increase in his salary. Maybe if he created another production company and owned more than 40% of it (as he owned 40% of Jan Grippo Productions) or hypothetically had enough money to buy Allied Artists Productions single-handedly. But his money wasn't landing at the production company. It was landing on top of the liquor store counter. He was in no condition to continue with the series, even if he did receive a salary increase. Maybe he could have continued with the series for an additional year at best. But he wouldn't have been doing himself any favours or his audienceany favors..

With Gorcey out of the series, Huntz Hall became the leader of the group. Therefore, for the final time, the group had another name change. The title of the group was now 'Huntz Hall and the Bowery Boys'. In Hall's group, there were only four members. In the first film, with Hall leading the series *Fighting Trouble* (1956), he was accompanied by Stanley Clements, David Gorcey, and Danny Welton. However, in their next film, *Hot Shots* (1956), Jimmy Murphy filled in for Stanley Clements. In their next picture, Stanley Clements and Jimmy Murphy acted together, with Danny Welton being replaced. *Hold That Hypnotist* (1957) introduced Eddie LeRoy as 'Blinky', with the group expanding to five members. Although there wasn't always going to be five members in the group, there were for *Spook Chasers* (1957) and *Looking For Danger* (1957), but when *Up in Smoke* (1957) began production, the group was back down to four members. It didn't really affect the group for that long, anyway, as Huntz Hall's Bowery Boys only had a seven-picture run. Therefore, their last picture in the series was entitled *In* *the Money* (1958). This picture shows Huntz Hall, Stanley Clements, David Gorcey, and Eddie LeRoy causing trouble together in London. It was the 48th film in the entire Bowery Boys series.

When placing all of the groups and series against one another, it was clear that the Dead End Kids had their best moments in the late 1930s, while the Little Tough Guys and the East Side Kids had their best moments simultaneously in the early 1940s. The Bowery Boys, however, never really had a 'best moment' in terms of quality. There was something they did have that was better than what any other group had—longevity. That group ran for a long time. Maybe even too long. Although there was no reason for Leo and the gang to stop producing 60+ minute pictures when they formulated more and more entertaining ideas each week, Their longevity was what really mattered. At least at the time. The influence of each group was fundamental not only to the kids' careers but also to each major studio's success. When you explore all four groups and all four film series', the group and series that stood out among them all was the Dead End Kids. That group maintained quality. Not just in terms of the members, but in terms of the pictures they were making over at Warners. If it wasn't for Universal hiring the kids, they maybe even could have made more crime pictures with Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney. Those pictures were special. The major stars that Warners put the kids up against made for entertaining yet serious pictures. Those that should be taken seriously are taken seriously.

The film series belonging to the Little Tough Guys, the East Side Kids, and The Bowery Boys were slightly different. They were just mostly entertaining. The first film that started the Little Tough Guys group can be placed up against Warner Bros.' *Dead End*, as both pictures saw Billy Halop play a troubled kid acting out and committing crimes, which led to him being on the run from the cops. Both pictures also show him being mentored by his older sister, who had a romance with a man that she grew up with. Meanwhile, the rest of the kids tried to help Billy Halop's character's and attempted to distract the cops and help out his sister. Those two pictures were actually pretty good. *Dead End* can be taken more seriously than *Little Tough Guy*, but both are individual pictures that stand on their own from both of the film series. The East Side Kids group can only really be examined through the film series itself, as it only got started once the main members of the Dead End Kids joined.

Every kid in every group, whether they were a main member, a supporting member, or a member that filled a role every now and again, still had a bad attitude and a ruthlessness towards them. Their morals were somewhat intact; they were just barely visible. The kids just wanted to run their neighbourhoods and town. They didn't care who stood in their way. Nobody was an obstacle to them. They may have enjoyed acting like criminals and may have gotten away with a lot of crimes, but there came a point wherein they were up against the cops, and they just had to know where the line was and what it would mean for their future. Even though they didn't always think of the consequences of their actions, Ultimately, having a group of tough kids star in a film series became a major trend at the time of their initiation. The trend was very popular. It was what nearly every major Hollywood studio either hoped to have or eventually sought out. Columbia Pictures had something close in their crime pictures, but they never had what Warner Bros. or Universal Pictures had. Even Universal Pictures didn't have what Warner Bros. had with their film series' containing a group of criminal kids, but they were the closest out of any major Hollywood studio.

**An in-depth personalised analysis of Martin Scorsese's *GoodFellas* (1990)**

Martin Scorsese's *Goodfellas* (1990), the film that he didn't want to make but had to, is considered by the average film viewer to be his best work. Those average film viewers, however, have probably only seen *Gangs of New York* (2002), *The Departed* (2005), *Shutter Island* (2010), and *The Wolf of Wall Street* (2013)—and maybe even *The Irishman* (2019). Nevertheless, those films could be his best work if almost every other film he has ever made since 1967 didn't exist, especially *Mean Streets* (1973), *Taxi Driver* (1976), and *Raging Bull* (1980). But they do exist. Those pictures are untouchable. I know this is already beginning to sound like a "*Goodfellas* isn't actually as important as everyone thinks it is" analysis, but it's not that kind of analysis. It's quite the contrary: *Goodfellas* is a prolific film within American cinema. It's maybe even the second-best modern gangster film ever made, after Francis Ford Coppola's *The Godfather* (1972). This analysis is more of a "Let's look at what makes *Goodfellas*, *Goodfellas.*". 

Therefore, it is important to look at the facts. When you come up through the film industry during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, there is going to be a time when a filmmaker, no matter their stature, must do a favour for a major studio. Or, at the very least, must give and take a little. That's what *Goodfellas* was for Scorsese. You see, Warner Bros. was backing the picture. But not because Scorsese asked them to. It was because he owed them, *Goodfellas*. It was a favour to Warner Bros. He didn't set out to make it. At that time, he was too focused on his passion project, *The Last Temptation of Christ* (1988), to even think about a studio gangster film. Although it's not a studio film in the conventional sense, Scorsese made it his own. It's a Scorsese picture. 

It's no secret that film language comes as naturally to Scorsese as the alphabet does to us. So, making a film that he didn't plan on making was not a major obstacle that he had to overcome. It was more of an inconvenience, one might say. It would be different if Scorsese conformed to studio filmmaking and made films for major Hollywood studios to recycle. If he did, he wouldn't have to do any favours for any studio; he would just be working for them within the Hollywood system. But that wasn't Scorsese, and it still isn't Scorsese. He is an independent filmmaker and always has been. Now, with all of that said, it's not as if anyone was holding a gun to Scorsese's head—forcing him to do it—the same way Karen does to Henry (in *Goodfellas*) as he wakes up in bed. He just knew that if he didn't do the film, he would have had to say goodbye to any chance of finance or distribution help from any studio. Alright, maybe that's a slight exaggeration, but he certainly would not have had any financial or distribution help from Warners again, that's for sure. That's a moot point now, though, because he did do it. He did it brilliantly. Scorsese was just surprised he had to make it. 

The way in which Scorsese tells the story is that he was informed by someone (it was almost certainly his agent) that he owes Warners a film. To which a meeting would have had to occur over at Warner Bros. There was a lot of representation at stake, and when I say a lot, I mean a lot. Scorsese's agent was representing him. Scorsese was representing the studio, and Warner Bros. was even representing the Motion Picture Association. Which is a trade association representing the American film industry as a whole. It's true that you could probably make the exact same case for any other motion picture that Warner Bros. has ever produced, but this wasn't just any motion picture. It was a risk for the studio, and, once again, you could technically say that about any major Hollywood studio. They all take risks at some point or another. Robert Evans took a major risk when he finally decided to greenlight *The Godfather* over at Paramount Pictures in the early 1970s, even though it was a risk to him and only him. 

Goodfellas was also a risk for Scorsese. He was getting in deep with a studio based on a favour. This could cause a major setback in his career. After all, he had a major setback in the late 1970s, not just in his career but in his life, following the release of *Taxi Driver*. Not specifically because of that film. He just didn't really know where he was going with his career after the film. The film industry was changing. So, the last thing he wanted or needed was another setback. He knew he would have to adapt to a different way of filmmaking, or at least, a different way of getting his films made. He didn't think he would be told if and when he could make a picture. Luckily, however, that didn't happen too often. Since then, he has been in full control of his career. If it had caused a major setback, he probably would have found a way out of it, but he couldn't be certain of that. I'm not saying that he was worried. But he wasn't sure if the film would ultimately be a success. What he did know, however, is that he could get himself out of any situation with his film skill set and knowledge. Obviously, for Warners, if they got a director wrapped around their finger and made commercial movies, they were happy. It would have been one less director to chase down and hire. As I've mentioned before, though, Scorsese wasn't—and still isn't—that type of filmmaker. 

If Scorsese could make *Mean Streets* and *Taxi Driver* for the rest of his career, with a religious film sprinkled in there every now and again, he would. In this day and age, he may be able to do any of those pictures, but it probably wouldn't be with the backing of any major Hollywood studio. The backing would come from a major player in streaming, as we have seen with his two most recent pictures, *The Irishman* and *Killers of the Flower Moon* (2023). Even through his contribution to American cinema, Scorsese has never been accepted by Hollywood—or even by the West Coast at all, for that matter. Hollywood has never really wanted to hear what he has had to say—or at least, the way in which he says it on screen. The very slim chance that they do want to hear what he has to say isn't because of how his filmmaking and storytelling style are going to tell it. 

In fact, the only reason Scorsese's films have ever received backing from any major Hollywood studio, including Warner Bros., is because they want the commercial profit from audiences seeking out the stars of his films. Studios want Hollywood stars attached to their projects to sell their films. They want the Robert De Niro's, the Daniel-Day Lewis's, and the Leonardo DiCaprio's of the film industry world. Trust me, it feels weird to even refer to them as "stars," as they are among the greatest actors of all time. But, in the eyes of the studios, it's true. I mean, De Niro was the main reason Columbia Pictures financed *Taxi Driver,* after De Niro won an Academy Award in the Best Supporting Actor category for *The Godfather: Part II* (1974). Daniel-Day Lewis' incredible critical acclaim doesn't even need to be mentioned, and *Gangs of New York* was financed by Miramax because of Leonardo DiCaprio's contribution to the critical and commercial success of James Cameron's *Titanic* (1997). Not to mention, Ellen Burstyn got the screenplay *Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore* (1974) because Warner Bros. desired to work with the actor once again after she finished production on *The Exorcist* (1973). 

Before Warners became attached to *Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore*, Scorsese received distribution help from Warner Bros. for *Mean Streets* and then again for *After Hours* (1985). So, when Warners needed a film from Scorsese—with Hollywood stars attached—in return for all of their help, well, you know the rest. I know all of that sounds like "this happened, and then this happened, and then this happened." But it pretty much did happen that way. I mean, I wasn't a fly on the wall during the meeting that occurred between Scorsese and the studio head. Therefore, I unfortunately have not obtained a transcript of what exactly went down at Warners. I just possess key information surrounding the film itself. Which is almost just as good as examining the origins of Goodfellas. 

So, what did Scorsese do to make Goodfellas, Goodfellas? Well, first of all, he made sure it was authentic. He told the truth. He didn't sugarcoat anything or try to make it something it wasn't. That may sound very basic, and it probably is when examining the work of Martin Scorsese. He knew what he was doing. He didn't really need to think it through to an enormous extent. He knew what the film needed to look and feel like. Thus, throughout the majority of the film, he knew it needed to look and feel like a documentary. The gritty aesthetic, locations, and grounded cinematography allow the film to not really feel like a film at all. There is still a story that we are following, but the way in which we are following it feels as though we are mostly just observing the characters, to a certain extent. Of course, Scorsese has always challenged different forms of filmmaking, and, in doing so, he has always tried to challenge the cinema landscape itself. He has definitely succeeded. He was the first filmmaker to use soundtracks during slow-motion sequences involving a character walking into a room, and he is renowned for his use of freeze frames as well as character narrations. 

Now, as much as Scorsese has all of his certified filmic techniques at his disposal, it would be wrong to not credit his life-long editing collaborator, Thelma Schoonmaker, for putting these techniques up on screen. Her unique editing skills and knowledge are what allow his motion pictures to become what they have become. Especially when they look and feel like a documentary. That's because they once worked together to make documentaries. They know what it takes to make one. To tell authentic stories. To articulate the human condition to the best of their ability. That's why, when it comes to making authentic films, they already have the knowledge of documentary filmmaking in their back pocket, with Scorsese behind the camera (not in a literal sense—at least, not anymore) and Thelma in the editing room. They know each other inside and out. Scorsese knows that Thelma understands his style, personal vision, and technical competence. While Thelma knows that Scorsese understands when a sequence should hold on a character's face for longer than 3 seconds to really understand how they are feeling, She also knows when the film should introduce slow motion editing techniques, character voiceovers, and the steadicam one shot involving Henry guiding Karen through Copacabana as they walk through the back entrance of the nightclub, through the kitchen, and past every waiter, the club owner, and Henry's friends. 

Although it may have taken Thelma a few pictures to actually understand that's what Scorsese wanted to do, their creative collaboration did not happen overnight, but they certainly had a head start on it. Their filmic and editing techniques never drew attention to themselves either. The techniques are just perfectly utilized. They are essential to the story. Yes, they are stylistic; there's no arguing that. But, once you discover the cinema language and can utilise it differently from the 'studio way', you actually have a film. Therefore, when it came to making *Goodfellas*, he had his partner in crime alongside him to pull from these filmic and storytelling techniques that they knew so well. 

In addition, Scorsese found motives within the gangster milieu that excited him to explore this underworld. He knew that in order to have the right actor by his side throughout this picture—to explore this underworld with him—he would need Robert De Niro. But not as the protagonist. For once, we are not guided through the story by De Niro's voiceover. He's not playing the main character. Ray Liotta did. Henry Hill is not what Travis Bickle or Jake LeMotta were to De Niro. In this picture, he plays a mentor to Henry Hill. A mentor with no morals, instilled with greed and rage, should have gotten him put in prison long before it actually did. But he was still a mentor. So, in a way, you could say De Niro's portrayal of James Conway (although he is always referred to as "Jimmy") is more important than what Henry is within the film, and you would probably be right. However, within the film itself, we are following Henry, not Jimmy. Why are we following Henry? It is because Scorsese always desires to tell a story from the inside out, not the outside in. It's not the first time he has done this, or the last. 

In the case of *Goodfellas*, we, as an audience, get to see the life that Henry lived from the inside out. We get to see how he became involved with Jimmy and the life that he lived in his family home—with his parents and, ultimately, with his wife and kids. It goes without saying that the film is about how power, greed, and moral obligations affect everyone. We all know that. But what Scorsese wanted to convey on screen is how it affected Henry the most. I mean, he was the one who shouldn't even have been involved in any of the corruption in the first place. None of them should. But especially not Henry. He just got greedy—with money, power, and being accepted by a family he could call his own. The only thing is, he took it all for granted. 

For Scorsese, convincing Joe Pesci to play the role of Tommy DeVito was not easy. But, then again, convincing Joe Pesci to play any role in almost any film is never easy. If he isn't on the golf course, he doesn't really want to do anything else. Although he did have a soft spot for Scorsese and De Niro, At least now he does. Pesci's contribution to *Goodfellas* was career-defining. Arguably, the most memorable moment in the film was due to his improvisation. He was the one to come up with the "Funny how?!" sequence. Of course, Scorsese put it together. But Joe told him about a story—almost identical to what we see between Tommy and Henry—that happened to him at a time in his life. As a result, it goes into the film. Pesci's contribution was completed. He was terrific throughout the entire picture. He produced an extremely menacing performance. But, at that moment—what else could you ask for, really?—the only other thing that could match that, and maybe even top it, is De Niro's "Are you talkin' to me?" improvisation in *Taxi Driver*. Which is perhaps the most memorable moment in the Scorsese classic—in popular culture, anyway? 

Ultimately, Scorsese has done better with *Goodfellas* than any other living filmmaker has done with a film that they have spent the vast majority of their career trying to perfectly construct. It feels silly to even praise Scorsese for any of his work. It's Martin Scorsese we are talking about. No living filmmaker is even close to him. His worst work is a lot of directors' best work. Although, does Scorsese even have any work that can truly be described as his "worst"? - Maybe *Bringing Out the Dead* (1999), *After Hours* (1985), or perhaps *Hugo* (2011). But they are different types of films—from each other and from his essential canon of work. 

A part of Scorsese always wishes he could go back to making low-budget New York street films. If Scorsese could make a pro's and con's list surrounding his new work, the pros would probably only consist of the advancement of film technology—creating a more efficient and smoother production shoot as well as more shot choices, perhaps. That is prevalent in *Killers of the Flower Moon,* 5–10 minutes into the picture. In *Goodfellas*, however, he doesn't need to rely on technological advancement. He needed to rely on his film knowledge. He always does; don't get me wrong. But, for this one, it wasn't as if he had as much time as he would have liked to prepare for it. Like I said, there comes a time when a filmmaker must do things that they never really intended to do but had to. Thankfully, most of Scorsese's work is what he wanted to do. Even if they weren't, he made it work, one way or another. He instilled a piece of himself in each project, whether he wanted to do it in the first place or not. Scorsese's pictures were his. No one else could do it the way he could. His identity was always there; it doesn't take much to notice it. *Goodfellas* was one of those pictures. An instant classic. Not only within his filmography but within the landscape of contemporary American cinema.
